            <h2>Water conservation has become essential in all regions, even where water seems abundant. That’s because our water resources are finite, and they are getting smaller every year. The main problems with water are water shortage, shortages of clean water, and waterborne diseases. A lack of safe water caused 80% of all deaths worldwide. More than 5 million people die yearly from water-related diseases such as hepatitis. Many countries worldwide face serious water shortages, with its root not really about the shortage of water but overpopulation. Repeated drilling and well building caused the water table to drop as much as six feet a year in some places</h2>

            <h2>Strategies to Support Water Conservation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Rainwater Harvesting</li>
                <li>Sustainable Water Usage</li>
                <li>Encourage Natural Regeneration of Vegetation and Supplement with Artificial Regeneration</li>
                <li>Maintain and IMprove the Quality of Water</li>

            <h2>Don't Use the Toilet as Wastebasket</h2>
            <p>Many people will throw a single object or thing down the toilet and flush the toilet. This can waste gallons of water. Instead of dumping them into the toilet, put it in the trash or recycle.

            <h2>Taking Shorter Showers</h2>
            <p>When we shower, we like to take our time making sure we are covered in soap but we also let the water run even when we aren't even using it. According to the website,”learn.eartheasy.com”, it says,” A four-minute shower uses approximately 20 to 40 gallons of water.”

            <h2>Insulate Your Pipes</h2>
            <p>Insulating your water pipes is easy and inexpensive. Doing this with pre-slit foam pipe insulation can help get hot water faster and can help avoid wasting water while it heats up.
